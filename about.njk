         <p>Hello there! I'm Dovydas Balionis, a web developer. I love learning the ins and outs of the platform and creating amazing websites along the way. This blog is my platform to share my software development journey. I write about what I learn, whether it's the latest coding techniques, captivating web design concepts, or industry trends.</p>
       
         <p>I started in the deep end, with my first full website being a custom WordPress e-commerce automotive paint store. From there, I completed a great code bootcamp at Coder's Guild, where I learned and started developing websites using Bootstrap, Node.js, 11ty, and pipelining to Netlify. This very blog is built using this tech stack. I'm currently hitting the books on React and Next.js to expand my front-end knowledge, so look out for blog posts related to them!</p>
